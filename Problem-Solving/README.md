# ðŸ’¡ Problem Solving (C or Python)  

This folder contains my solutions to HackerRank **Problem Solving** challenges written in C.  
Each file starts with a comment explaining the approach I used.  

## Problems Covered  

1. **Simple Array Sum**  
   - Loop through the array and add each element to compute the sum.  

2. **Compare Triplets**  
   - Compare Aliceâ€™s and Bobâ€™s ratings element by element.  
   - Award points based on higher values and return both scores.  

3. **A Very Big Sum**  
   - Handle very large integers (up to 10^10).  
   - Iterate through the array and accumulate values into a `long` to avoid overflow.  

4. **Diagonal Difference**  
   - Compute the sum of the left-to-right diagonal and the right-to-left diagonal of a square matrix.  
   - Return the absolute difference between these two sums.  

5. **Plus Minus**  
   - Count positive, negative, and zero values in the array.  
   - Print their ratios as decimals with 6 places of precision.  

6. **Staircase**  
   - Print a right-aligned staircase pattern using `#` symbols.  
   - Each line decreases spaces and increases `#` characters until the base is complete.
