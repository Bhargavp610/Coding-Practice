# 💼 Meta Coding Practice Problems

This folder contains my **Meta (Facebook) coding practice problems**, focused on logic, accuracy, and clear problem-solving.  
The problems are similar in style and difficulty to those asked in Meta’s early screening rounds.

Each solution includes:
- A concise problem description
- The required function signature
- A fully commented and readable implementation

---

## 📌 Problems Covered

### 1. Sum of Three Integers
**Problem:**  
Given three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`, determine their sum.

**Task:**  
Implement `getSum(A, B, C)` to return `A + B + C`.

**Concepts:**  
Basic arithmetic, function implementation.

---

### 2. Wrong Answers (Multiple-Choice Test)
**Problem:**  
You are taking a test with `N` questions, where each answer is either `A` or `B`.  
You know the correct answers in string `C`, but want to score **0** by answering every question incorrectly.

**Task:**  
Implement `getWrongAnswers(N, C)` that returns a string where each character is the wrong choice.

**Concepts:**  
String manipulation, conditional logic.

---

### 3. Battleship Hit Probability
**Problem:**  
You are playing Battleship on a grid with `R` rows and `C` columns.  
Each cell contains either a battleship (`1`) or empty water (`0`).  
A single shot is fired at a random cell.

**Task:**  
Implement `getHitProbability(R, C, G)` to calculate the probability of hitting a battleship.

**Concepts:**  
2D array traversal, counting, probability.

---

### 4. Cafeteria Seating (Social Distancing)
**Problem:**  
Given a row of `N` seats and existing diners positioned such that `K` seats on each side must remain empty, determine the maximum number of additional diners that can be seated without violating distancing rules.  
Existing diners cannot move, and new diners cooperate to maximize seating.

**Concepts:**  
Greedy logic, interval analysis, edge-case handling.

---

## 🧠 Key Focus Areas

- Writing clean, readable code with correct function signatures
- Precise handling of logic and edge cases
- Practicing problems similar to **Meta/Facebook entry-level assessments**
- Ensuring correct integer and floating-point calculations where required

---

## 📝 Notes

- All problems are solved in **Python**
- Each `.py` file includes:
  - Problem description
  - Function definition
  - Step-by-step comments explaining the logic
- Code prioritizes clarity, correctness, and efficiency

---

## 🔮 Next Steps

This folder will continue to grow with additional Meta-style challenges, including:
- Arrays and Strings
- Greedy algorithms
- Basic recursion
- Sorting and search techniques

This repository serves as a curated collection of **Meta-style warm-up and logic problems** for interview preparation.
