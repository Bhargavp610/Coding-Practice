# üíº Meta Coding Practice Problems  

This folder contains my **Meta (Facebook)** coding practice problems.  
Each file includes the problem statement, function definition, and a fully commented solution.  

These problems focus on **logic, basic algorithms, and coding accuracy** ‚Äî similar to questions asked in Meta‚Äôs early screening rounds.

## Problems Covered  

1. **Sum of Three Integers**  
   *Problem:*  
   Given three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`, determine their sum.  
   *Task:*  
   Implement the function `getSum(A, B, C)` which returns `A + B + C`.  
   *Concepts:* Basic arithmetic, function implementation.

2. **Wrong Answers (Multiple-Choice Test)**  
   *Problem:*  
   You‚Äôre taking a test with `N` questions (each answer is either `A` or `B`).  
   You know the correct answers in string `C`, but want to score **0** by intentionally answering each one incorrectly.  
   *Task:*  
   Implement `getWrongAnswers(N, C)` which returns a string of length `N` where each character is the wrong choice.  
   *Concepts:* String manipulation, conditional logic.

3. **Battleship Hit Probability**  
   *Problem:*  
   You‚Äôre playing Battleship on a grid with `R` rows and `C` columns.  
   Each cell may contain a battleship (`1`) or be empty (`0`).  
   You fire one shot at a random cell and want to find the probability of hitting a ship.  
   *Task:*  
   Implement `getHitProbability(R, C, G)` which returns the probability of hitting a battleship.  
   *Concepts:* 2D array traversal, counting, probability.

## üß† Key Focus Areas  

- Writing clean, readable code with correct function signatures  
- Handling logic and conditional cases precisely  
- Practicing problems similar to **Meta/Facebook entry-level assessments**  
- Ensuring accurate floating-point outputs where required  

---

## üìù Notes  

* All problems are solved in **Python**.  
* Each `.py` file starts with:
  - Problem description  
  - Function signature  
  - Comments explaining logic step-by-step  
* Code is designed to be clear, correct, and efficient.

## üîÆ Next Steps  

I‚Äôll keep adding more Meta-style challenges covering topics like:  
- Arrays and Strings  
- Greedy algorithms  
- Basic recursion  
- Sorting and search logic  

This folder serves as a growing collection of Meta-style warmup and logic problems.
