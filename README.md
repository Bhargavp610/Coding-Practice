# 🚀 Coding Practice Repository  

Welcome to my **Coding Interview Practice** repo!  
This is where I track my journey of sharpening problem-solving skills through **HackerRank** and **CodeSignal** challenges.  

Instead of only relying on platforms like LeetCode, I built this repo to:  
- ✅ Document my solutions by topic (SQL, Python basics, and common problem-solving challenges).  
- ✅ Show consistent progress with commits and updates.  
- ✅ Keep a clean record of how I approach problems, not just the final answer.

## 📂 Repository Structure  

Each folder represents a **topic area**. Inside, you’ll find:  
- Solution files (`.py` or `.sql`) with problem statements + my code.  
- Comments at the top of each file explaining the problem, approach, and notes.

* Each file starts with comments that explain the problem and my approach.
* The goal isn’t to show “perfect” answers but to **demonstrate learning and growth** over time.

## 🌟 Why This Repo Exists

Interview prep can be scattered across platforms. This repo pulls my work into one place so I can:

* Track my coding practice consistently.
* Share progress with recruiters, mentors, or peers.
* Build discipline around problem-solving.
