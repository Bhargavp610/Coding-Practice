# üêç Python Practice Problems  

This folder contains my Python coding practice problems solved on HackerRank.  
Each `.py` file starts with a short comment describing the approach I used.  

## Problems Covered  

1. **Weird or Not Weird**  
   - Use conditional statements and modulus operator to decide if the number is "Weird" or "Not Weird".  

2. **Arithmetic Operators**  
   - Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication of two integers using simple operators.  

3. **Division**  
   - Perform integer division (`//`) and float division (`/`) between two integers and print results on separate lines.  

4. **Loops (Squares)**  
   - Use a for loop to print squares of all non-negative integers less than `n`.
