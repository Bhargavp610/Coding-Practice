# üêç Python Practice Problems  

This folder contains my Python coding practice problems solved on HackerRank.  
Each `.py` file starts with a short comment describing the approach I used.  

## Problems Covered  

1. **Weird or Not Weird**  
   - Use conditional statements and modulus operator to decide if the number is "Weird" or "Not Weird".  

2. **Arithmetic Operators**  
   - Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication of two integers using simple operators.  

3. **Division**  
   - Perform integer division (`//`) and float division (`/`) between two integers and print results on separate lines.  

4. **Loops (Squares)**  
   - Use a for loop to print squares of all non-negative integers less than `n`.  

5. **Leap Year**  
   - Write a function `is_leap(year)` that returns `True` if the given year is a leap year, otherwise `False`.  
   - Logic: A year is a leap year if it‚Äôs divisible by 400, or divisible by 4 but not by 100.  

6. **Print Function**  
   - Print numbers from `1` to `n` in a single line without using built-in string methods like `join`.  
   - Approach: Use a loop to concatenate string representations of integers from 1 through n, then print the result.  

7. **List Comprehensions**  
   - Use a list comprehension to generate all coordinate triples `(i, j, k)` in a 3D grid where `i + j + k != n`.  
   - This avoids nested loops and ensures output is in lexicographic order.  

8. **List Operations**  
   - Implement a dynamic list that supports commands: `insert`, `print`, `remove`, `append`, `sort`, `pop`, and `reverse`.  
   - Use helper functions for modularity and iterate through commands using `split()` to parse arguments.
